Academic Background
------
- PhD, Finance, The University of Edinburgh
- Master, Finance, The University of Melbourne
- Bachelor, Accounting and Finance, The University of Melbourne


Research and Teaching Interests
------
My research and teaching interests involve corporate finance, asset pricing, and behavioral finance. Within corporate finance, my research addresses capital structure, financing and new issues, dividend policy, capital expenditures, mergers and acquisitions, and foreign direct investment, and I approach these topics from the perspective of behavioral mechanisms such as catering, market timing, and reference point thinking. Within asset pricing, my research addresses stock and bond return characteristics, investor sentiment, index-driven investment, benchmarking, performance evaluation, and ESG. 


Working Papers
------
[The Noise Share of the 52-Week High Effect on Mergers and Acquisitions](https://brant1868.github.io/) (with Leonidas G. Barbopoulos, Yue Liu, and Jo Danbolt). _Working Paper_.
- Main findings: The target reference point effect depends on the percentage of noise in the target share price. The reference point effect might not always be value-destroying.
- Presentations: AFA2025-Poster, EFMA2025, FMA2025

[A Win-to-win Explanation of Extraordinary Acquirers](https://brant1868.github.io/) (with Leonidas G. Barbopoulos, and Yue Liu). _Working Paper_.
- Main findings: Acquirers’ high-return previous takeover deal can lead to higher returns in the subsequent deal when it fosters information production about the acquirer.

[Firm-level Data Assets and Inorganic Growth](https://brant1868.github.io/) (with Leonidas G. Barbopoulos, and Yue Liu). _Working Paper_.
- Main findings: Develop firm-level data assets measures using economic modelling and a large language model, examine how data revolution promotes acquisition activities.

[Firm-level Data Assets and Organic Growth](https://brant1868.github.io/) (Single Author). _Working Paper_.
- Main findings: Firm-level data assets promote firms' data-to-day investment (capital and R&D) and improve investment efficiency through operational efficiency instead of product innovation.

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

Skills
------
The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
